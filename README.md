# NeekhaProjects

**Machine Learning Project**

This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze data, train predictive models, and evaluate their performance. The implementation is done in a Jupyter Notebook using Python and popular ML libraries.

**Features**

1. Data preprocessing and cleaning.
2. Feature selection and transformation.
3. Model training using algorithms like (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, etc.).
4. Model evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics.
5. Visualizations.

**Technologies Used**

1. Python
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Libraries:
*pandas, numpy – for data handling*

*scikit-learn – for model training and evaluation*

*matplotlib, seaborn – for data visualization*
